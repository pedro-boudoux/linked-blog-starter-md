## Clear Communication
- Web users want information quickly
- Organize content into chunks for readability
- Use bullet points (unordered lists) for listing items

## Fonts
- Proper fonts increase readability and effectiveness
- "Web-safe" fonts appear across all operating systems
- Key font types:
    - Sans Serif: modern, clean (Arial, Verdana)
    - Serif: traditional, with extra bits on letter ends

### Best Practices
- Ideal font size: 16px
- Use maximum of 3 fonts in 3 different sizes
- Font pairings: Consider sans-serif for titles, serif for body text
- Web-safe fonts include: Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman, Courier, Verdana, Georgia

### Font Resources
- Google Fonts (fonts.google.com)
- Typewolf ([www.typewolf.com](http://www.typewolf.com))
- Fonts in Use (fontsinuse.com)

## Colors
- Use balanced color palettes
- Contrasting colors improve readability
- Very high/low contrast can cause eye strain
- Recommendations:
    - Use dark gray instead of pure black on white
    - White text on 70% gray is better than white on pure black

## Images
- Images can convey complex information efficiently
- Graphics and infographics often communicate better than text

## Navigation
- Critical for user retention
- Elements of effective navigation:
    - Logical page hierarchy
    - Breadcrumbs
    - Well-designed clickable buttons
    - "Three-click rule" - information should be findable within 3 clicks

## Scanning Patterns
- Users scan rather than read web pages initially
- Common patterns:
    - *F-pattern*: horizontal movement across top, shorter horizontal scan below, vertical scan down left side
    - *Layer-cake*: focusing on headings/subheadings, ignoring paragraphs
    - *Spotted*: looking for specific text
    - *Bypassing*: deliberately skipping portions

## Load Time
- Critical for user experience and SEO rankings
- Key statistics:
    - 47% expect pages to load in 2 seconds or less
    - 40% abandon sites that take more than 3 seconds to load
    - Pages loading in 2 seconds: 9% bounce rate
    - Pages loading in 5 seconds: 38% bounce rate
    - 79% of dissatisfied shoppers won't return to slow sites

## Mobile Friendliness
- Websites must work across multiple devices and screen sizes
- Options:
    - Responsive design
    - Dedicated mobile site optimized for mobile users
