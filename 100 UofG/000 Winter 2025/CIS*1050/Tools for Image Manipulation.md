# Tools for Image Manipulation

Sometimes images need to be manipulated to enhance their appearance. These modifications can range from simple adjustments to more complex edits, often achievable with tools like Lightroom or Photoshop. Numerous other free, low-cost, and online options (both paid and free) are also available.

## Basic Image (Photo) Manipulation

Improving an image's appearance often involves simple adjustments like contrast, brightness, saturation, and sharpness. It's advisable to edit with a purpose, avoiding unnecessary effects. Mobile devices often have built-in editing capabilities.

## Image Rotation

Correcting tilted images, such as those with an uneven horizon, is easily done by rotating the image.

## Image Cropping

Cropping involves extracting a specific portion of an image, useful when only a part of the original is needed.

## Image Enhancement

Enhancement aims to make images more aesthetically pleasing by adjusting contrast or boosting colors.

## Image Sharpening

Sharpening increases the contrast along edges, making details appear finer and crisper.

## Photo Blur

Blurring softens specific areas of an image, which can also make the unblurred parts appear sharper. Selective blurring can emphasize certain elements.

## Image Scaling

Scaling changes the size of an image:

-   **Downsampling:** Reducing the number of pixels to make a large image smaller (loses information but reduces file size). A 50% reduction in dimensions results in a 75% reduction in file size.
-   **Upsampling:** Increasing the number of pixels to make a small image larger (theoretically doesn't lose information but may require "guessing" pixel values, potentially affecting quality).

The quality of the original image significantly impacts the results of scaling. Low-resolution images can appear distorted, pixelated, or blurry after scaling.

## Applying Filters

Filters can be applied using mobile apps or online tools to achieve various effects, such as a vintage look with a vignette.

## Tips for Image Manipulation

-   **Resolution:** Avoid uploading excessively large (high-megapixel) images. Downsample when possible.
-   **Cropping:** Utilize cropping to change image size, shape, or to refocus attention by removing unnecessary parts.
-   **Adjust Contrast:** Enhance the difference between light and dark areas to improve visual impact.
-   **Adjust Colors:** Modify color saturation or convert to black and white to fit the webpage's theme.

## Image Optimization

Optimizing images reduces their file size without significantly compromising quality, leading to:

-   Improved page loading speed.
-   Better Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
-   Faster website backups.
-   Reduced bandwidth usage (beneficial for mobile).
-   Less server storage space.

Optimization depends on the image file format and compression techniques. For web use, very high-resolution images are usually unnecessary.

### Pixels

The file size of a web image is directly related to its pixel dimensions. Viewing an image at 100% in an editor and then reducing its size can help determine the optimal dimensions for quality and file size. A 50% reduction in dimensions typically reduces the file size by 75%.

### Compression

-   Saving images as JPEGs with lower quality is a simple way to reduce file size. The quality loss depends on the image's detail.
-   Image compression apps can also reduce file size.
