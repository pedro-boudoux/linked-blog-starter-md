# Designing for E-Commerce: The Basics

## Core Purpose
- Convert visitors → customers → repeat customers.
- Every bit of content affects purchasing decisions.
- Even indirect sellers must guide users to *where* to buy specific products.
- Info must be customer-centric: focus on clarity, accessibility, and actionability.

## Simplicity & Minimalism
- Minimal > complex, unless site's UX is already well-known (e.g. Amazon).
- Use **white space** to create separation between elements.
- Prevent cluttered menus or ambiguous elements (e.g. cart item count).
- Good minimalism = **enough info**, but avoid huge text blocks.

## Navigation
- Menu bar = consistent across all pages.
- Highlight current location.
- Avoid too many items (even in dropdowns).
- Apply **Hick’s Law**: more choices = slower decisions.

## Search & Filters
- Search must be obvious, preferably top-right.
- Allow **filters** post-search (e.g. price, brand).
- Sorting (e.g. date, relevance) improves UX on large inventories.

## Shopping Cart
- Icon must be familiar, visible (top-right), interactive.
- Show item count, expandable preview, easy quantity editing.
- Give feedback (e.g. free shipping status, payment types).
- Avoid full-page redirects for cart view (unlike Amazon).

## Images & Video
- High-res product photos: show *all angles*, defects, scale.
- Clean backgrounds (white ideal), good lighting.
- Use galleries and zoom features.
- Videos: demos, usage, assembly = more confidence.
- Host on YouTube when possible.

## Pricing, Shipping, Checkout
- Pricing must be visible. No “contact for price” unless dynamic.
- Show shipping estimates *before* account creation.
- Avoid hidden fees = lower cart abandonment.
- Guest checkout = good UX.
- Incentivize account creation *after* purchase (e.g. for tracking).

## Cart Abandonment Causes
1. Unexpected fees (shipping).
2. Account creation forced before checkout.
3. Complex checkout process.
4. Slow site performance.

## Product Categorization
- Over ~30 items? Use categories.
- Organize logically to streamline browsing.

## Layout & Cards
- Use **grid** layout with **cards** (image + title + brief info).
- Cards support **scanability**, are **mobile-friendly**, and responsive.
- Useful for product and service listings (e.g. Airbnb, blogto).

## The Customer
- Always thank after purchase.
- Confirmation builds trust, gives closure.

## FAQ
- Anticipate questions; answer proactively.
- Build trust via transparency.
- Link to relevant sections within site.
- Cover international shipping and common pain points.

## Social Media
- Standard icon usage for recognizability.
- Open links in **new tab**, never disrupt session.
- Helps with **SEO** and trust.
