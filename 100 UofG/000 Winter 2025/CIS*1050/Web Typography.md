# Web Typography

## What Is Typography?

Typography in web design refers to the *appearance and structure of text on a webpage*. While fonts are a key part, typography also includes:
- Legibility (visual clarity)
- Readability (ease of comprehension)
- Spacing between letters, words, and lines
- Relative text sizes

Good typography enhances user experience by making content easy to read and aesthetically coherent.
## Key Elements of Typography

| Font Family     | Font Sizes |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Helvetica       | Title      |
| Times New Roman | Heading    |
| Verdana         | Paragraph  |
| Georgia         |            |


## Paragraph Indents
Separate paragraphs using **either**:
- First-line indent **OR**
- Space between paragraphs  
*(never both)*

> The **first paragraph** after a heading should *not* be indented.

| Indents | Space Between Paragraphs |
|--------|---------------------------|
|   Espresso is coffee of Italian origin... | Espresso is coffee of Italian origin...<br><br>Espresso is coffee of Italian origin... |

## Text Alignment
### Types of Alignment

- **Left-aligned**: Default for readability; used in books and most body text.
- **Center-aligned**: Best for short text (e.g., titles, lyrics); harder to track.
- **Right-aligned**: Used in rare contexts (e.g., image captions).
- **Justified**: Avoid in HTML; can cause awkward gaps unless hyphenation is perfect.

| Left Alignment | Centre Alignment |
|----------------|------------------|
| Espresso is coffee of Italian origin... | Cruel shape<br>Oh what have I done<br>Punching a wall<br>Nearly broke my thumb<br>It’s harder than you think<br>Not that it matters<br>If I show myself to you |

## Vertical Text Spacing
Vertical spacing affects how easy it is to read multi-line text. Adjust based on context.
## Line Length
Keep lines under **80 characters** to reduce eye fatigue and improve tracking.

| Short Line | Long Line |
|------------|-----------|
| Espresso is coffee of Italian origin... | Espresso is coffee of Italian origin, brewed by expressing or forcing a small amount of nearly boiling water under pressure through finely ground coffee beans. |

## Additional Typographic Guidelines
- **Use minimal fonts** — Too many makes the site chaotic.
- **Prefer sans-serif fonts** for screen use.
- **Adjust font sizes per font**:  
  - Arial & Georgia: 10pt  
  - Times New Roman: 12pt
- **Use mixed capitalization** — All-caps ≠ good UX.
- **Use standard fonts** — Faster to read.
- **Limit font colors** — Max of 4.
- **Avoid blue text** — Users assume it's a link.
- **Avoid red and green** — Colorblind users.
- **Ensure contrast** — Text must stand out from background.
- **No erratic text** — Avoid blinking/moving text. It screams amateur.
