## Common Problems with Images

Several issues can arise with images on a website, affecting their display or being caused by the images themselves.

### The website is slow because it is full of images that aren’t optimized for the web.
-   Using large, high-megapixel images directly on a website significantly increases page load times.
#### Solution:
Optimize images for web use by finding a balance between file size (MB or KB) and quality (resolution). Refer to "Image Optimization" for techniques.

### The images do not look right on screen. Maybe this is because of blurriness or pixelation.
-   This is often due to insufficient resolution.
#### Solution:
Aim for a resolution between 72-120 PPI (pixels per inch) for acceptable to optimal quality. Avoid excessive compression when saving images, as it can degrade quality.

### The focal point of the image isn’t obvious.
-   Sometimes, the main subject or purpose of an image is unclear.
#### Solution:
Crop the image to highlight the area of interest, making its relevance to the surrounding content clear to the visitor.

### The image is poorly composed.
-   The aesthetic appeal of an image is crucial for engagement.
#### Solution:
Choose well-composed images that are visually appealing and eye-catching. Consider artistic principles like the "Rule of Thirds," repetition, and the use of positive and negative space during photography.

### The image looks distorted.
-   This usually happens when images are scaled non-proportionally.
#### Solution:
Maintain the original aspect ratio when resizing images (scaling up or down) to prevent stretching or squashing.

### The image isn’t accessible.
-   Lack of associated metadata hinders accessibility.
#### Solution:
Ensure images have descriptive filenames, alt text, captions, and relevant keywords. While some metadata is automatically generated, providing textual information improves user experience, especially for screen reader users.

### The image is boring.
-   Over-editing can make images look unnatural and unappealing.
#### Solution:
Apply simple image manipulation techniques judiciously to enhance, not detract from, the image's natural appearance.

### The colours don’t look right.
-   Color perception can vary across different screens.
#### Solution:
Calibrate your screen to ensure accurate color representation. Be aware that printed colors may also differ from on-screen display.

### You’re using generic stock photography.
-   Using overly common stock photos can make a website feel impersonal and unoriginal.
#### Solution:
Avoid generic stock photos whenever possible. Opt for unique, high-quality visuals that are relevant and authentic to your content or brand.
