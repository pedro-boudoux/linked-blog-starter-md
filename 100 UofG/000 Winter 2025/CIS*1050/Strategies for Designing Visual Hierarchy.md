## Basic Concepts
- Humans are visual creatures - processed visual information before text
- Visual hierarchy: organization of elements to guide attention and create depth
- Created through size, color, contrast, shape, positioning, and arrangement

## Visual Hierarchy Principles
- Elements ranked naturally based on visual properties (e.g., circles of different sizes/colors)
- More important elements should receive more attention
- Example: Instagram using red dots/bubbles to indicate notifications

## Common Design Approaches
### 1. Establish Defined Scanning Patterns
- People typically read top-down and left-to-right
- Users scan rather than read every word
- Two main scanning patterns:
    - **F-pattern**: Used for text-heavy pages and consistent block content
        - Horizontal movement across top
        - Second shorter horizontal scan below
        - Vertical scan down left side
    - **Z-pattern**: Used for more visual/graphical pages
        - Start top-left, move to top-right
        - Diagonal movement down to left side
        - Repeat pattern moving down page
- Examples: Stockholm Arlanda Airport website, Etsy homepage
### 2. Use White Space
- Often overlooked but critical design element
- Benefits:
    - Improves focus and attention
    - Creates simplicity and elegance
    - Elements with more surrounding white space attract more attention
- Applications:
    - Most websites avoid background images
    - Product photos often use white backgrounds for clarity
    - Balancing white space is crucial (too much = lack of content; too little = disorganization)
### 3. Use Repetition
- Creates stronger mental impressions
- Easier for minds to absorb
- Apply to: fonts, color schemes, line thickness, shapes
- Essential for theme consistency and unification

### 4. Breaking the Flow
- Strategic interruptions renew user attention
- Motion attracts the eye (use subtly)
- Examples:
    - Auto-play videos
    - Cinemagraphs (static images with small moving elements)
- Warning: Too much disruption can drive users away
## Case Study: Amazon's Purchase Box
- "Add to Cart" button at top of visual hierarchy
- Key elements highlighted with color: Add to Cart button, price, stock status
- Size and color draw attention to most important action
