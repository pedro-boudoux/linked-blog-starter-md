# Design Concepts: Notes on Design Principles

## Divine Proportions: The Golden Ratio

- Golden Ratio = 1.618 (represented by Greek letter phi)
- Derived from natural asymmetry observed by Greeks
- Used in credit cards, books, furniture, ancient buildings, artworks
- Famous users: Leonardo Da Vinci, Salvador Dali
- Golden Rectangle: length is 1.618 times its width (e.g., 1000px Ã— 618px)
- Can be applied to font sizes (body: 10pt, heading: 16pt)

## Hick's Law: Less is Better

- Developed by William Edmund Hick (1952)
- Principle: Decision time increases logarithmically with number of choices
- Related to Paradox of Choice: too many options can lead to no decision
- Applications in web design:
    1. Categorize choices (e.g., blog categories)
    2. Limit number of choices (simplified forms, limited navigation)
    3. Divide and conquer (break processes into smaller steps)
    4. Hide complex features except for advanced users
- Include effective filters and search options

## Fitts' Law

- Named after Paul Fitts (1954)
- Formula: Time to target = function of distance and target size
- Larger objects that are closer are easier to use
- Logarithmic relationship (small buttons benefit more from enlargement)
- "Rule of target size": Size should match frequency of use
- Example: Deep drop-down menus are frustrating to navigate

## Gestalt Design Laws

- Based on Gestalt psychology (1920s German psychologists)
- Core principle: Humans see objects in entirety before perceiving parts
- Four key concepts:
    1. **Emergence**: People identify elements by general outline first
    2. **Reification**: People recognize objects even with missing parts
    3. **Multi-stability**: Ambiguous objects interpreted in multiple ways
    4. **Invariance**: Objects recognized regardless of rotation/scale/position
- In web design: Users see the "whole" website before individual elements

## Six Design Laws

1. **Proximity**: Items close together perceived as one group
2. **Similarity**: Similar items (color, shape, size) perceived as related
3. **Closure**: Minds complete incomplete shapes
4. **Symmetry**: Objects perceived as symmetrical around center point
5. **Common Fate**: Objects moving in same direction perceived as group
6. **Continuity**: Lines perceived as continuing in established direction

## Occam's Razor

- Choose the explanation with fewest assumptions
- In web design: Simplest solution is usually best
- Example: Google's minimalist homepage design
