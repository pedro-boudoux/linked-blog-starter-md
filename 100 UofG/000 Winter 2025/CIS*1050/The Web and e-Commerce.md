## Why is e-Commerce Important

### 1. It Can Broaden a Brand
Pairing a physical store with an online presence turns a local business into a global one with 24/7 availability and digital engagement.

### 2. Convenience
Online stores let customers shop anytime, which fits modern schedules and appeals to people who avoid physical shopping.

### 3. Increased Reach
Websites are globally accessible, giving businesses access to millions of potential customers. (e.g, 27 mil in Canada, 220 mil in the U.S.).

### 4. Marketing
Websites boost discoverability via SEO and integrate easily with social media marketing for wider exposure.

### 5. Scalability
e-Commerce makes it easy to grow- add products, payment options, or shipping zones- without relocating or upsizing.

### 6. Data
Online shopping generates rich data for personalizing user experience and forecasting inventory needs.
