## Where are Websites Stored?
A *web host* provides the service that gets the website out on the internet for all to see. They provide a wealth of services including web space, monthly bandwidth, domain names, email accounts, databases, and a series of web building tools.

**Webspace**: Storage space, similar to what you would find on a computer, or mobile device. (For storing the files and stuff).
**Bandwidth**: The traffic or amount of data that is transferred to and from a website.
**Database**: Blogs or shops will require a database.

## What is a Domain Name?
A *domain name* is a web address that identifies a website - what people type into the browser to access your website. 

Each computer has a unique *ip address*, which allows computers to communicate with one another.

## Planning a Website
A website was once something you could cobble together with a bit of HTML code. Now things are intrinsically more complicated from a content perspective. However, there is also an abundance of tools users can leverage to make a website without resorting to writing complicated code. The most important part of building a website is planning it:

- What is the website for?
- Will it be a blog, or just for information?
- Is the website being used to promote a business, or sell a product?
- Is the audience a local one, or a global one?
- Will the website provide information in one language, bilingual, or multiple languages?
- Will visitors to the website be allowed to interact with it?
- Will a mobile client be required?

As you can see, there are many things to consider before the design process even begins.
