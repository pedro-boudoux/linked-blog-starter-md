## Elements of On-site SEO

### Meta-data and Structure
- **Meta-data**: Hidden from visitors but accessible to search engines
    - Optimize in-page meta-data for titles, descriptions, headers, images

- **Page titles**: Appear at top of browser, tell search engines what the page is about
    - Should contain key terms

- **Sub-headings**: Use H1, H2, H3 tags to help search engines understand content

- **Internal links**: Help search engines derive information about a site
    - Example: Blog post about a historic site should link to that site

- **Images**: Include proper image names and ALT tags
    - Helps search engines index images
    - Image searches are important

### Content
- Essential for attracting search engines
- Relevant content leads to higher search rankings
- Best practices:
    - Create varied content types (blog posts, social media, guides, videos, infographics)
    - Ensure content is original, regularly updated, well-written, and abundant
    - Use appropriate keywords and phrases that match search queries

## Technical Aspects of SEO
- **Link Structure**:
    - Good internal linking helps users navigate
    - Helps search bots understand site hierarchy
    - Include curated external links relevant to content

- **Page Load Speed**:
    - Faster loading = better user experience = better ranking

- **Mobile Compatibility**:
    - Many Google searches are performed on mobile devices
    - Non-mobile-friendly sites may rank lower

- **Content Management System (CMS)**:
    - Choose one with SEO-friendly features:
        - Search engine friendly URLs
        - Easy content creation and caching
        - Metadata forms
        - Optimization for your website type
    - WordPress noted as very SEO friendly

## SEO for Mobile
- Google modified mobile search algorithm in 2015 to incorporate "mobile-friendliness"
    
- Focuses on user experience factors:
    
    - Links far enough apart for thumb-clicking
    - Text large enough to read without zooming
- Google's three approaches to mobile-friendliness:
    
    1. Traditional responsive web design
    2. Dynamic serving
    3. Separate mobile site (m.domain)

## Evaluating SEO

- Recommended resources:
    - Google's Webmaster Tools (free)

## "About" Pages

- Often overlooked but critically important
- Should tell a story that humanizes your brand
- Good stories provide context and meaning
- Good stories are "sticky" - memorable and shareable
- Use descriptive, emotive copy and quality graphics
- A story-based "About Us" page works harder than a generic one
