## Fixed vs Sticky Navigation

### Fixed Navigation

- Traditional style  
- Menu scrolls **with** the page and disappears as user scrolls down  
- Example: Amazon  
- Pros:
  - Less distracting
  - No "jumpy" UI
- Cons:
  - Users may get lost
  - Requires scrolling back up to navigate

### Sticky Navigation

- Modern style  
- Menu stays **in view** as the user scrolls  
- Pros:
  - Constant access to navigation
  - Reinforces branding (logo always visible)
  - Encourages exploration of site
- Cons:
  - Can be distracting
  - Sometimes feels "jumpy"
  - More complex to implement

### Hybrid Example

**Blists Hill Victorian Town**

- Uses layered sticky nav:  
  - Top menu stays sticky *just long enough*  
  - Lower orange menu scrolls up and **becomes** the sticky nav
