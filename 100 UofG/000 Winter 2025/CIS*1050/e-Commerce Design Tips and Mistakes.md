## E-Commerce Design Tips and Mistakes

### Design Tips

- **Tell a Story**
    - Build emotional resonance with a brand narrative
    - Explain product origins, transformation, target audience
        
- **Good Navigation**
    - Fast, clear access to product info and buying options
    - Search + filters are baseline requirements
        
- **Colour**
    - Use intentionally (e.g., green = eco, earth tones = natural)
    - Evoke emotion, reinforce brand identity
        
- **Photographs**
    - High-quality, original, emotionally evocative
    - People remember images more than text
        
- **Think Like a Visitor**
    - Is navigation intuitive?
    - Are products easy to find, understand, and buy?

### Design Mistakes

- **Lack of Responsive Design**    
    - Non-mobile-friendly = dead on arrival
    - People won't return if it doesn't work on their phone
        
- **Not Customizing Themes**
    - Default themes = forgettable + generic
    - Aesthetic differentiation is critical
        
- **Unreadable Typography**
    - No edgy fonts that sacrifice legibility
    - Limit font styles/sizes, avoid low-contrast combos
    - Don't overlay text on cluttered images
        
- **Using Jargon**
    - Clarity > Cleverness
    - Kill acronyms, insider lingo, and vague corporate buzz
        
- **Poor Navigation**
    - If users canâ€™t find it in <10s, they bounce
    - Stick to familiar layouts (top or left nav)
    - Use a proven theme if unsure
    
- **Lack of Relevant Content**
    - Product info must be clear, accurate, updated
    - Incomplete or outdated = instant distrust
    - Good content = better SEO + conversions
