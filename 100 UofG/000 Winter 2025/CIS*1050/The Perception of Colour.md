### WHY COLOUR MATTERS
- **Recognition + Expectation**: Tomatoes = red. Trees = green. Deviate and ppl get weird.
- **Emotional Resonance**: Colour triggers vibe â€” blue = trust, red = danger/love/rage, green = clean/$.
- **Pre-linguistic Communication**: Red = stop ðŸ”´, green = go ðŸŸ¢. No words needed.

### B&W â‰  Bad
- **When Done Rightâ„¢**: Can scream class (see: Le Swan, Monotype).
- **When Done Wrong**: Screams "what even is this" (see: s-i-l-o.fr).
    

---

### MONOCHROMATIC â‰  B&W
- **One Hue â‰  No Hue**. Monochrome can be _any_ colour (see: Drury Buildings, everything RED).
- **High Risk, High Aesthetic Reward**: Pulling it off takes _taste_.

### BIOLOGICAL LIMITS
- Humans: ~1M colours seen (avg), 32 greys.
- Computers: ~16.7M colours.
- Displays lie. Perception varies.

### HEX BASICS
- `#000000` = black. `#FFFFFF` = white. Middle values = everything else.
- RGB = base system. 256 shades/channel.

### BAD COLOUR = BAD UX
- Exhibit A: George R. R. Martinâ€™s fever dream.
- Exhibit B: arngren.net = chaos in HTML form.
- Too many colours = nothing stands out.

### COLOUR = CULTURE
- **Meanings Arenâ€™t Universal**:
    
    - Red = weddings (China) / death (Nigeria).
        
    - White = purity (West) / mourning (Asia).
        
    - Orange = fertility (Colombia) / royalty (Netherlands).
        
- Know your audience. Global â‰  one-size-fits-all.

### COLOUR IN BRANDING

- Consistency = memorability.
    
- Ex: Starbucks = green. Home Depot = orange. Twitter = blue.
    
- WOW Air = _very purple_. It worked (until it didnâ€™t).
    

---

### WHY EVERYONE USES BLUE

- Universally liked (Joe Hallock/Faber Birren data).
    
- Evokes **trust**, **security**, **authority**.
    
- Women like purple too, men... not so much.

    - Canva â†’ extract from images.
        
    - Contrast Checker â†’ accessibility sanity check.
