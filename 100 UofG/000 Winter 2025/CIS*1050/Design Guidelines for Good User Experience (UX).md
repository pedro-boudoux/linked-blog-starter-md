# The 6 Guidelines
There are several guidelines from the perspective of what the user expects. These end up being incorporated into the actual design of the website:

1. Simplicity
2. Visual Hierarchy
3. Navigability
4. Consistency
5. Accessibility
6. Conventionality

## Simplicity
- Users judge websites in milliseconds, the *simpler* a website is the *more beautiful*.
- Visitors come to act or find info, not admire design- avoid unnecessary elements
- *Simplicity aids usability* via cognitive fluency (brain prefers ease)
- Repeated exposure to familiar layouts builds user preference

### Tips for Simplicity
- **Color**: Limit pallet; avoid busy visuals
- **Fonts**: Max 3 types, 3 sizes; script fonts = bad
- **Graphics**: Only use graphics if they are functional

## Visual Hierarchy
- *Visual Hierarchy* guides users to key actions naturally via layout
- Uses *position*, *color*, and *size* to emphasize important elements
- Improves UX by making navigation intuitive

*Example*: The website in the example above highlights the "Travel Deals".

## Navigability
- **intuitive navigation** helps users find info without thinking too hard
- main nav should be **simple and top-positioned**
- repeat nav links in the **footer**
- use **breadcrumbs** to show user’s location
- include a **top-positioned search bar**
- avoid deep click paths (no 7-level nav mazes)
- nav elements must be **consistent** across pages

*Example:* sbb.ch buries language selector in bottom-left—bad for tourists, should be more prominent

## Consistency
- **consistency** in design (colors, fonts, layout) improves usability
- similar pages should share a **cohesive look**
- **multilingual sites** must keep language usage consistent
- offering **simplified versions** for other languages is fine, but must still be coherent

*Example:* _dsb.dk_ switches to English, but leaves menu in Danish—confusing for non-speakers

## Accessibility
- Accessibility = inclusive design
- Sites must be *responsive* across devices, different OSses, and browsers
- good UX = content adapts to screen size, language, location, currency
- basic a11y (accessibility): add **alt-text** to images for visually impaired users
- responsive + adaptive = better, faster task completion for everyone

## Conventionality
- users expect **design conventions** like top-left logos, hoverable links, and navigation consistency  
- **deviation** from these norms causes confusion and worsens UX  
- **familiarity** in design helps avoid forcing users to re-learn basic functions

*Example*: shopping cart icons should be **consistent**—don’t confuse with bags or baskets
