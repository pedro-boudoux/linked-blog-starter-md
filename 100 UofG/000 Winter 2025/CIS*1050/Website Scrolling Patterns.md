# Scrolling Patterns in Web Design

Scrolling is one of the most fundamental interactions on the web. While vertical scrolling is standard, there are other types that suit different kinds of content and layouts.

## Horizontal Scrolling

Horizontal scrolling is rare on desktop but more common on mobile. It can work well for:

- Visually rich sites
- Slideshows or galleries
- Layouts with limited vertical space

It’s unconventional and might confuse users if not clearly indicated.

## Long Scrolling

Used for linear storytelling and content-rich pages. Often seen on:

- Social media
- News feeds
- Single-page websites

Works well with constantly updating content or when categorization isn’t clear. Long scrolling is also mobile-friendly and fast since it avoids complex navigation.

### Fixed Long Scrolling

A variant where different sections are displayed in one long stream. Sometimes feels like "scroll within a scroll."

## Infinite Scrolling

Best for massive content libraries. Content loads as the user scrolls, which keeps things flowing smoothly.

- Common on blogs, social media, and news sites
- Reduces interruption
- Works well for multimedia-heavy pages

## Parallax Scrolling

Uses multiple visual layers moving at different speeds. Creates a subtle 3D effect and visual depth.

- Good for storytelling and immersive pages
- Bad for content-focused sites
- Can slow down load times

Can be minimal or intense, from background shifts to full-on animation sequences.
