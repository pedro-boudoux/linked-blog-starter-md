## Who Invented the Web?

## Who Controls the Web?
No one really controls the web, but it is managed by the *World Wide Web  Consortium (W3C)*

## How does the Web Work?
The web is made up of what we call a *client-server model*. Websites are built and maintained on a *server*, somewhere in the world.

Web pages are comprised of one or more files that are downloaded to a computer, then interpreted by a *web browser*.

### Browsers
*Browsers* are the client end of things. They interpret and the HTML, CSS and JS files that web servers send us when we request it.
