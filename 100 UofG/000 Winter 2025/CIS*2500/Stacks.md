## Stacks
*Stacks* are a *linear* data structure. All of its components are arranged in a *straight line* (i.e: they are *sequential*).

On a *stack*, you add and remove components from the same end. *Adding* is called *push* and *removing* is called *pop*. The order in which an element is added to or removed from a stack is described as "last in, first out", *LIFO*.
