## Linked Lists
A *linked list* or *list* is a common structure with many applications, it is one of the easiest structures to build and use.

A *linked list* is more flexible than an *array*, it allows us to insert or delete nodes in itself as needed.

However, we lose the *"random access"* ability than an *array* gives us. Any element in an array can be accessed in the same amount of time. Accessing a *node* in a *linked list* on the other hand, requires us to traverse to that node so the speed depends on whether the *node* is *at the end or the beginning* of a *linked list*.

## What is a Linked List?
A *linked list* consists of a chain of structures (called *nodes*) with each node containing a pointer to the next node in the chain.
