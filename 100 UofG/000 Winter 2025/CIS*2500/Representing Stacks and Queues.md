## Representation
*Stacks* and *queues* can be built using either *linked lists* or *sequential* memory (arrays).

### Linked List Representation
The linked list representation requires dynamically allocated structures to be added/removed.

### Sequential Representation
With *sequential representation* we use array indices instead of pointers. The implementation is just an array (of whatever type we're working with).

## Abstract Data Type (ADT)
A collection of data structures, variables and functions that operate on them.
