## Queues
*Queues* are a *linear* data structure. All of its components are ordered in a straight line, they are *sequential*.

On a queue, you *add* and *remove* components from the *opposite* ends, *FIFO* (first in first out), you add an element to the *head* and you remove elements from the *back*, hence the terms *enqueuing* and *dequeueing*.
