## Algorithms
An *algorithm* is a set of actions, that move from an *initial state* and proceed through a number of actions until a *terminating condition* is reached. *Algorithms* can be analyzed as to their use of space and time.

For *searching* and *sorting* algorithms see [[Searching Algorithms]] or [[Sorting Algorithms]].
