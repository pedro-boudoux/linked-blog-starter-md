## Coloring of Graphs
*Coloring* [[Graphs]] involves the assignment of colours to vertices such that no two adjacent vertices are the same colour.

The *chromatic number* of a graph $G$, is the *least number* of colours necessary to colour it.

### The Four Colour THeorem
The *chromatic number* of a planar graph is always less than or equal to 4.
$$\text{Chromatic Number} \leq 4$$
