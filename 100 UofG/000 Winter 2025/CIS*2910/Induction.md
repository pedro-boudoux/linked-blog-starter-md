A proof by *induction* is a method to prove statements about natural numbers by proving a base case and then showing that if the statement is true for a given number, it's also true for the next number.

### Strategy for Induction Proofs
#### 1. Basis Step
Prove the base case.

#### 2. Inductive Step
Assume $P(k)$ is true. State the *inductive hypothesis* when $n=k$.

#### 3. Consider case after $k$.
Consider the case for $P(n)$ when $n = k+1$, prove that $P(k+1)$ is true.
