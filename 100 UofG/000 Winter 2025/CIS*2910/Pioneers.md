**Class:** [[Discrete Structures in Computing II]]
**Date:** 03-04-2025
**Topics:**

For some reason, the midterm in this course and the final in CIS1910 included questions about different scientists and researchers and their discoveries about Discrete Math. So I have to write this note.

## 1. Sloane 
Neil James Alexander *Sloane* created the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).

## 3. Pascal
*Pascal* did a lot I don't even want to start talking about it not going to lie. Pascal's Identity and stuff.

## 5. Ruskey
Frank *Ruskey*'s research involves algorithms for exhaustively listing discrete structures, combinatorial Gray codes, Venn and Euler diagrams, combinatorics on words, and enumerative combinatorics. Frank Ruskey is the author of the original Combinatorial Object Server (see http://combos.org).
